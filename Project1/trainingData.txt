The field of artificial intelligence, or AI, goes further still: it attempts not just to 1
Work started in earnest soon after World War II, and the name itself was coined 1
AI currently encompasses a huge variety of subfields, ranging from general (learning and perception) to 1
We will see that the concept of rationality can be applied to a wider variety 1
The observation that some agents behave better than others leads naturally to the idea of 1
An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and 1
Goal-based agents, on the other hand, consider future action and the desirability of their outcomes 1
Problem-solving agents use atomic representations, as described in Section 2.4.7 - that is, states of the 1
Our discussion of problem solving begins with precisie definitions of problems and their solutions and 1
We begin with a fairly simple case: Sections 4.1 and 4.2 cover algorithms that perform 1
The key idea is that if an agent cannot predict exactly what percept it will 1
Finally, Section 4.5 investigates online search, in which the agent is faced with a state 1
In this chapter we cover competitive environments, in which the agents' goals are in conflict 1
In AI, the most common games are of a rather specialized kind - what game theorists 1
Games have engaged the intellectual faculties of humans - sometimes to an alarming degree - for as 1
From the point of view of the search algorithm, however, each state is atomic, or 1
We use a factored representation for each state: a set of variables, each of which 1
CSP search algorithms take advantage of the structure of states and use general-purpose rather than 1
They make strong claims about how the intelligence of humans is achieved - not by purely 1
For example, the transition model for the 8-puzzle - knowledge of what the actions do - is 1
Chapter 6 introduced the idea of representing states as assignments of values to variables; this 1
Unfortunately, propositional logic is too puny a language to represent knowledge of complex environments in 1
Our discussion motivates the development of first-order logic, a much more expressive language than the 1
Programming languages (such as C++ or Java or Lisp) are by far the largest class 1
Section 9.1 introduces inference rules for quantifiers and shows how to reduce first-order inference to 1
We begin with some simple inference rules that can be applied to sentences with quantifiers 1
Let us begin with universal quantifiers. Suppose our knowledge base contains the standard folkloric axiom 1
In this chapter we introduce a representation for planning problems that scale up to problems 1
Section 10.2 shows how forward and backward search algorithms can take advantage of this representation, 1
This chapter covers fully observable, deterministic, static environments with single agents. Chapters 11 and 17 1
This chapter shows how. Section 11.1 extends the classical language for planning to talk about 1
For example, the planners of Chapter 10 could produce a schedule for an airline that 1
The approach we take in this section is "plan first, schedule later": that is, we 1
In this chapter we address the question of what content to put into such an 1
Section 12.2 covers the basic categories of objects, substances, and measures; Section 12.3 covers events 1
In "toy" domains, the choice of representation is not that important: many choices will work. 1
An agent may never know for certain what state it's in or where it will 1
Despite its many virtues, however, this approach has significant drawbracks when taken literally as a 1
Suppose, for example, that an automated taxi has the goal of delivering a passenger to 1
We define the syntax and semantics of these networks and show how they can be 1
Furthermore, specifying probabilities for possible worlds one by one is unnatural and tedious. 1
We also saw that independence and conditional independence relationships from among variables can greatly reduce 1
From the belief state and a transition model, the agent can predict how the world 1
The transition and sensor models may be uncertain: the transition model describes the probability distribution 1
We have developed our techniques for probabilistic reasoning in the context of static worlds, in 1
Such an agent can make decisions in contexts in which uncertainty and conflicting goals leave 1
Section 16.2 shows that the behavior of any rational agent can be captured by supposing 1
Decision theory, in its simplist form, deals with choosing among actions based on the desirability 1
Sequential decision problems incorporate utilities, uncertainty, and sensing, and include search and planning problems 1
In such environments, the notion of optimal behavior is complicated by the interactions among the 1
Suppose that an agent is situated in the 4 x 3 environment shown in Figure 1
In this chapter we will concentrate on one class of learning problem, which seems restricted 1
If the design of the agent can be improved, why wouldn't the designers just program 1
Any component of an agent can be improved by learning from data. The improvements, and 1
To most users, a compiler can be viewed as a "black box" that performs the 1
Compilers therefore allow programs and programming expertise to be machine-independent. This is a particularly valuable 1
The term compiler was coined in the early 1950s by Grace Murray Hopper. Translation was 1
It is an extremely simple language, lacking even enough features to write a useful program. 1
The structure of this compiler is based on that illustrated in Figure 1.3. In the 1
The definition of Micro tokens can be formalized, as we shall see in Chapter 3. 1
The Micro scanner we saw in Chapter 2 was quite simple and could be easily 1
At first glance this may seem unnecessary, given the sample token structure found in most 1
A precise definition of tokens is obviously necessary to ensure that lexical rules are properly 1
A context-free grammar (CFG) is defined by the following four components: 1
The vocabulary V of a CFG is the set of terminal and nonterminal symbols (that 1
Starting with S, nonterminals are rewritten using productions until only terminals remain (at which point 1
We also define LL(1) parsers, which use an LL(1) parse table rather than recursive procedures 1
They are also frequently used to automatically generate a parser. The idea here is to 1
As we learned in Chapter 2, recursive descent parsers use parsing procedures to match the 1
This is by no means trivial. More than one production may have the same right-hand 1
The parse stack catenated with the remaining input always represents a right sentential form. Tokens 1
The problem is to know when we have reached the end of the handle, then 1
The semantic routines, the part of the compiler that interprets the meaning (semantics) of a 1
Analysis is completed in that the semantic routines associate semantic information from declarations with all 1
We begin our discussion of semantic processing by looking first at the most general approach 1
A symbol table is a necessary component of a compiler because the definition of a 1
This chapter is mainly concerned with implementation issues, but we first consider an abstract definition 1
This interface provides an abstract view of a symbol table in that it doesn't specify 1
Algol 60 and succeeding languages introduced features that required stack allocation, in which space is 1
A data area is a block of storage for variables and other objects known to 1
In many early languages, notably assembly languages and FORTRAN, all storage allocation is static. Space 1
The second section outlines the semantic routines necessary to process a simple subset of the 1
A "record" is the term used in Algol-derived languages for what C calls a "structure." 1
In Chapter 8, symbol tables were presented as a means of associating names with some 1
This record is complex, for it is used to describe literal constants, variables, components of 1
They will be discussed in the appropriate sections of this chapter. 1
The representation for data objects that we have chosen assumes that we want the front 1
The statement types to be considered can be classified into three categories: looping structures, conditional 1
A significant difference from the Pascal if statement is the use of the closing keywords 1
The form of the tuples produced for if statements is shown in Figure 12.1. Two 1
As is the case with any other declaration, the declaration of a subprogram results in 1
Ada and Ada/CS include distinct syntactic forms for procedures and functions, and they allow either 1
The semantic routines in these productions use one new semantic record type, SUBPROGRAM. An instance 1
The semantic routines form the most crucial part of a compiler because they finish the 1
The first section of this chapter is a details presentation of attribute grammars, which were 1
Attribute grammars were proposed by Knuth (1968) as a means of including semantics with the 1
Most importantly, the translation phase, incorporated into a compiler's semantic routines, is overwhelmingly source language-dependent 1
This may seem facetious, but there are circumstances in which it is desirable to have 1
A simple compiler might produce a tree-structured IR that can be interpreted by an execution 1
